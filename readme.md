GWSDroidLava
============

# Introduction

This is a fork of AOSP's copy of DocLava which in facts is not the updated 
version of DroidLava at GoogleCode. AOSP's copy is derived from DroidLava 1.0.3 as of 
previous years to 2013 up until Android OS version 4.x. This is why you might 
be having trouble inproducing javadocs embedded in a website if you are attempting 
to use DroidLava jar from the code.google.com project.

This is a temproary fork and is no longer necessary when the AOSP copy is updated 
to the code.google.com version, but that time has not arrived just yet.
